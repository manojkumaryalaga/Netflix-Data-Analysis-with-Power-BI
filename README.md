ðŸ”§ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling Multi-value Columns

Columns like cast, director, and country often contain multiple values separated by commas.

These were split into individual entries to allow detailed analysis of each actor, director, and country.

Language Standardization

The language column contained symbols, abbreviations, or inconsistent names.

A mapping table was created to convert all entries into standard full language names (e.g., EN â†’ English, FR â†’ French).

Removing Irrelevant Columns

Columns without analytical value were removed to reduce noise.

General Cleaning

Handled missing/null values

Trimmed extra spaces and standardized text formatting
