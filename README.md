### ðŸ”§ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

**Handling Multi-value Columns**  
- Columns such as cast, director, and country often contained multiple values separated by commas.  
- These were **split into individual entries** to enable detailed analysis by actor, director, and country.  

**Language Standardization**  
- The language column had symbols and inconsistent names.  
- A **mapping table** was used to convert abbreviations into full language names (e.g., `EN â†’ English`, `FR â†’ French`).  

**Removing Irrelevant Columns**  
- Removed columns that did not contribute meaningful insights to simplify analysis.  

**General Cleaning**  
- Handled missing/null values  
- Trimmed extra spaces and standardized text formatting  
- Unified categorical naming conventions  

### ðŸ§® DAX Queries

DAX measures were created to handle post-cleaning duplicates and enable meaningful aggregations:

Distinct Movie Count â€“ Counts each unique movie title once.

Total Budget (Distinct) â€“ Calculates the sum of unique movie budgets.

Total Revenue (Distinct) â€“ Aggregates distinct revenues per movie to avoid duplication after splitting multi-value columns.

Language Category â€“ Categorizes titles into English vs Non-English for comparative analysis.
